<h2>Benefits</h2>

<h3>Conference access</h3>
<p>Two days of high-caliber talks about Python, and meeting new Pythonistas at North Bay Python.</p>

<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>In order to keep ticket costs as low as possible, we don't cater lunch.</p>

<p>To make up for it, we’ve located our conference right in the middle of Historic Downtown Petaluma’s restaurant district. You can find everything from market delis and California barbecue, through to Michelin-recommended restaurants, all within 5 minutes walk. You’ll get a better lunch than we’d ever be able to cater, for much less. We'll have a locals' guide to Petaluma to help you find places to eat.</p>

<h3>Morning Refreshments</h3>
<p>We'll provide coffee, tea, hot chocolate, and some light snacks in the morning before proceedings kick off on both days.</p>

<h3>T-Shirt</h3>
<p>We’ll be designing a collectible North Bay Python t-shirt for sale on-line by the time the conference comes around, and they’ll be available in a variety of sizes, cuts and colors.</p>


<h3>Affiliation</h3>
<p>Every attendee gets their very own lanyard and a badge with their name on it. For higher-paying ticket holders, you’ll get your project’s name (supporter and above) or company name (corporate or sponsor levels only) on your badge, just below your name.</p>

<h3>Supporter Recognition</h3>
<p>On our website, we’ll have a list of our conference supporters. You can choose to have your name on that list.</p>

<p>For our corporate and sponsor ticket holders, we’ll also include your company name as part of those thanks.</p>

<h3>Sponsor Benefits</h3>
<p>Sponsor tickets come with sponsor benefits. To find out more, see our <a href="/sponsors/become-a-sponsor">Sponsors page</a>.</p>


<h3>Childcare</h3>
<p>We'll be offering childcare at a nearby venue. If you have children, we'll have qualified care providers available to take care of them. Parents can find more useful information on our <a href="/accommodations">Accommodations</a> page.</p>

<h3>Accessibility and Accommodations</h3>
<p>Please check out our <a href="/accessibility">Accessibility and Accommodations</a> page. Whether you have mobility, hearing, or vision issues, or a service animal, dietary restrictions, or something else you need to consider to navigate North Bay Python, we've got you covered. Please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:hello@northbaypython.org">reach out</a> if you have questions we can help answer!</p>

<h3>Opportunity grants</h3>
<p>If you don't have an employer paying to send you to North Bay Python, we encourage you to <a href="/attend/finaid">apply for an opportunity grant</a>. We can help defray the cost of travel, food, and lodging, as our goal is for attending North Bay Python to cost you about as much as staying home.</p>
